### Simple Portable Movie DataBase

A simple portable database for storing information about movies.

This database in based on _SQLite_ database.

This project was created to use a web browser, let it not be a surprise, to 
browse a collection of video files with a web browser. As the experiment has 
shown, most of the modern web browsers have very poor support for playing 
various video formats. So, unfortunately, this project will be frozen until a 
better media support will be available in web browsers.
