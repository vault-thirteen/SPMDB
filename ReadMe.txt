S.P.M.D.B.
Simple Portable Movie DataBase.

A simple portable database for storing information about movies.
This database in based on SQLite database.

This project was created to use a web browser, let it not be a surprise, to browse a collection of video files with a web browser. As the experiment has shown, most of the modern web browsers have very poor support for playing various video formats. So, unfortunately, this project will be frozen until a better media support will be available in web browsers.
